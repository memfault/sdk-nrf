Auracast: Broadcast Configuration Tool
######################################

   :depth: 2

The Broadcast Configuration Tool sample implements the :ref:`BIS gateway mode <nrf53_audio_app_overview>` and may act as an `Auracastâ„¢`_ broadcaster if you are using a preset compatible with Auracast.
The sample features a shell interface that allows you to configure the broadcast source in many different ways.

In the BIS gateway mode, transmitting audio from the broadcast source happens using Broadcast Isochronous Stream (BIS) and Broadcast Isochronous Group (BIG).

The following limitations apply to this sample:

* Audio input: Pre-encoded LC3 data from an SD-card.
* Maximum two BIG with four BIS streams each.

.. _broadcast_configuration_tool_requirements:

The sample supports only and exclusively the following development kits:

.. table-from-rows:: /includes/sample_board_rows.txt
   :header: heading
   :rows: nrf5340_audio_dk_nrf5340

.. note::
   The sample supports PCA10121 revisions 1.0.0 or above.
   The sample is also compatible with the following pre-launch revisions:

   * Revisions 0.8.0 and above.

Shell commands list
*******************

The Broadcast Configuration Tool uses a shell interface for all user interactions.
This section lists the supported commands.

Description convention
======================

The command argument description uses the following convention:

* Angle brackets mean that an argument is mandatory:

  .. parsed-literal::
     :class: highlight

     bct <*arg*>

* Square brackets mean that an argument is optional:

  .. parsed-literal::
     :class: highlight

     bct [*arg*]

----

start
=====

     bct start 0

----

stop
====

Stop the broadcaster.
The optional argument sets the index of the BIG to stop.

Usage:

.. _broadcast_configuration_tool_configuration:

Configuration
*************

|config|

The sample is pre-configured with a generous default memory allocation, suitable for a wide range of use cases.
You can modify these default settings in the :file:`prj.conf` file.
Using aggressive configurations can reduce air time availability for all streams, depending on the combination of options selected (like high bitrates, increased re-transmits, specific PHY settings).

.. _broadcast_configuration_tool_building:

Building and running
********************

.. |sample path| replace:: :file:`samples/bluetooth/broadcast_config_tool`

.. include:: /includes/build_and_run.txt

The nRF5340 Audio DK comes pre-programmed with basic firmware that indicates if the kit is functional.
See :ref:`nrf53_audio_app_dk_testing_out_of_the_box` for more information.

.. _broadcast_configuration_tool_testing:

Testing
*******

In this testing procedure, the development kit is programmed with the Broadcast Configuration Tool sample.

To test the Broadcast Configuration Tool sample, complete the following steps:

#. Turn on the development kit.
#. Set up the serial connection with the development kit.
#. Configure a BIG using use case 1:

   .. code-block:: console

      bct usecase 1

#. Start the broadcaster:

   .. code-block:: console

      bct start

You can now send other shell commands, as listed in the :ref:`broadcast_configuration_tool_ui`.
