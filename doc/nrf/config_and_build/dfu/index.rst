Device Firmware Update (DFU) is the procedure of upgrading the application firmware version on a device.
It is composed of two steps.
First a new firmware image is transferred to the chip, and then the :ref:`bootloader <app_bootloaders>` tests and boots the new firmware.

You can transfer the updated images to the device in two ways:

* Wired, where updates are sent through a wired connection, like UART, or delivered by connecting a flash device.
* Over-the-air (OTA), where updates are sent through a wireless connection, like BluetoothÂ® Low Energy.

The testing and booting process depends on the choice of bootloader.
Generally, bootloaders support two types of updates:

* Direct updates, with an in-place substitution of the image.
  In this case, it is the bootloader that must transfer the update image.
* Background updates, where the updated image is obtained and stored by the application, but the update is completed by the bootloader after the device reboots.

Based on these criteria, the |NCS| offers support for the following DFU alternatives:

* For sending updates to the receiving device:

    * - Method
      - Description
      - Supported transfer
    * - :ref:`nRF Util <toolchain_management_tools>`
      - Multi-purpose command line tool that can be used to send SMP-formatted updates to MCUmgr, among other things.
      - Wired (SMP over UART or USB)
    * - Cloud interfaces
      - Each cloud comes with its specific interface to send updates to devices from the cloud. See documentation for :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud`, :ref:`lib_aws_fota` or :ref:`lib_azure_fota`.
      - OTA (LTE, Wi-Fi)
    * - :ref:`zephyr:mcumgr_cli`
      - Command line tool specifically for sending updates to the MCUmgr library.
      - Wired (SMP over UART or USB) and OTA (SMP over Bluetooth LE)
    * - `nRF Connect Device Manager`_
      - Mobile application for sending SMP updates over Bluetooth LE; can also be used for other SMP functionality.
      - OTA (SMP over Bluetooth LE)
    * - `nRF Connect for Mobile`_
      - General purpose mobile application that can be used for sending SMP updates over Bluetooth LE, among other things.
      - OTA (SMP over Bluetooth LE)
    * - :ref:`SMP Client <zephyr:mcumgr_smp_protocol_specification>`
      - SMP Client running on a microcontroller. For an example over Bluetooth LE, see :ref:`bluetooth_central_dfu_smp`. It can alternatively be implemented using the :ref:`zephyr:mcu_mgr` library.
      - Wired (SMP over UART or USB) and OTA (SMP Client over Bluetooth LE)

* For receiving updates on the device side:

    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Method
      - Description
      - Supported transfer
    * - :ref:`zephyr:mcu_mgr`
      - Library in Zephyr that implements the Simple Management Protocol (SMP); used to receive or send updates over different protocols.
      - Wired (SMP over UART or USB) and OTA (SMP over Bluetooth LE)
    * - :ref:`lib_dfu_target`
      - Library in the |NCS| used to do DFU for data from any source.
      - Data is provided by the application and it is up to the application to receive the updates. Transport is application-specific.
    * - :ref:`lib_fota_download`
      - Library in the |NCS| that provides functions for downloading a firmware file as an upgrade candidate to the DFU target. The library is often used by IoT libraries, such as the :ref:`lib_nrf_cloud` library.
      - OTA (LTE, Wi-Fi)

See the following pages for device-specific guides related to DFU:

* :ref:`qspi_xip` - for the nRF5340 SoC
* :ref:`ug_nrf70_fw_patch_update` - for nRF70 Series devices
